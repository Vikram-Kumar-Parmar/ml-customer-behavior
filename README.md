# 📊 Customer Behavior Analysis & Segmentation Project

A comprehensive Data Science project that analyzes and segments customer behavior using **Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **K-Means Clustering** models. This notebook dives into real-world business applications, particularly for the **electronics retail sector**, providing insights that help improve customer retention, personalization, and sales strategies.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Predict customer purchase behavior using Regression models.
- Understand complex customer decisions via Decision Trees.
- Segment customers into meaningful groups with K-Means clustering.
- Generate actionable business recommendations based on model insights.

## 🧠 Models Used

### 🔷 Regression Model
- **Goal:** Predict continuous values like purchase amount or lifetime value.
- **Strengths:** Simple, interpretable, reveals impact of individual features.
- **Limitations:** Assumes linearity, sensitive to outliers.

### 🌳 Decision Tree Model
- **Goal:** Classify customer behavior (e.g., will buy or not).
- **Strengths:** Handles non-linear relationships, intuitive flowchart structure.
- **Limitations:** Can overfit, sensitive to data variation.

### 🌀 K-Means Clustering
- **Goal:** Group similar customers without labeled data.
- **Strengths:** Unsupervised, great for identifying segments like high/low spenders.
- **Limitations:** Requires pre-defined `k`, sensitive to centroid initialization.
